This is an implementation of the PODEM algorithm used for generating test patterns.
In addition to that, the controllability and observability maps have been generated, which would be used while making a decision in the PODEM algorithm

The use of controllability and observability maps should reduce the number of back tracking decisions in PODEM.

Files:
main.py: has the code to generate the maps, read netist and incoves PODEM
podem_new.py: has the program to generate test vectors using PODEM
Fault_Collapsing.csv: It is used to optimize the fault list

The Benchmark used are ITC99 benchmark circuits.
